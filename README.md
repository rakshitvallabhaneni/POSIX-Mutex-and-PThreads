# POSIX-Mutex-and-PThreads
This program deminstrates how POSIX Mutex and Pthreads can be used to achieve synchronization.(Semaphores have not been used)

Two rival families, the Capulets and the Montagues, fight 
each  other  every  time  they  have  a  chance.    The  city 
authorities are especially concerned by the ranged battles 
that occur day after day on the main plaza of the city.  You 
are  hired  by  the  authorities  of  the  city  to  write  plaza 
management program ensuring (a) that no Capulet will 
enter the plaza when Montagues are present and (b) that no 
Montague will do the same when Capulets are present.  
Since the city is small, you can safely assume that plaza 
will never be overcrowded.
